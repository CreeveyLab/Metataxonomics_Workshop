Homoploymer sites: 24
The observed size of the largest cluster is 50
The estimated upper bound abundance for this tag is 598
	(note! this abundance is different from the abundance of this species, which
	may has several copies of this tag with or without variations) 

Suggested cutoff value to remove small cluster is 3
Representative sequences for large clusters will be used in next cluster run for OTU calculation
At this cutoff, the tags with abundance <3 will be missed, 
In addition,

The probability for tags with abundance 36 is about 0.5
